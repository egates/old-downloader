some of the very first programs I wrote professionally
all I really knew at the time was Pascal, that was was being taught in college as an intro class prior to a class in c. 
I had done some Fortran as well and knew SQL but, because I knew Pascal, this is what I used to do my very first automation.
Our division was responsible for the pricing of mutual funds and that involved downloading the day's transactions which was a manual process.
I automated that process.
